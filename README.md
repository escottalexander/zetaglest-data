ZetaGlest is a fork of [MegaGlest](http://megaglest.org/), a network
multi-player cross-platform 3D real-time strategy (RTS) game, where you
control the armies of one of eight different factions: Tech, Magic,
Egypt, Indians, Norsemen, Persian, Elves or Romans. The game is played
in one of 17 natural looking settings, which, like the unit models,
are crafted with great attention to detail. A lot of additional game
data can be downloaded from within the game at no cost.
